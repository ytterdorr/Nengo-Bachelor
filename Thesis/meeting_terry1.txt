We don't have examples of end to end neural models with vision, motor control, cognition. 

Sequencing. 
But pretty low level. 


Starting

Trying to start as simple as possible. 

Main sensory system. 

Step 1
Set up an environment. 
can give information about 5 balls in 

"Camera vision". 
- Keeps track of 5 objects, 

Output motor commands to wheels. 


They have something from the course. 

Get started with the 

What are the right structures. 
Run through the basic tutorials. 

Use nengo to open the forage.py, 

2. Implementing just one of the actions. Like point at the object. 

3. How to sequence. Not by doing a flowchart, but doing one block in a flowchart. Just show that we have the system setup so that we can have the input and the output going to the agent. 

4. Start expanding things out. One of the action sequences. 

5. Implement other ones. Allow it to change goals. 

117-19 stores sensory data
Doing some kind of 

Connection is allowed to specify a function to be computed on that connection.

(If on left -> turn left, if onright turn right)

Input -> State, 
State -> Turn



Academic gain is: Noone has this sort of complex animal behavior end to end in spiking neurons. With vaguely realistic biology. 

Do nothing about vision. 

Getting at least one of those types of actions. Like go find the goal. (Ball)

Might, if can, go find á¸¿ultiple goals. 
(Stretch, maybe in summer.)

Weekly meetings over that timeframe. 

Emailing quick questions.  

Running through the Nengo Tutorials again.

Building neural model rather than understanding the environment. 

Setting up environment for multiple agents. Terry takes a stab at that. 

End of tutorials goes into how to sequence actions.

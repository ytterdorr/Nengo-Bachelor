Meeting 16/5


Why does the action_state in turn_object.py get stuck on TURN?
- How to set priorities between input and state?

Does not prioritize between action rules and input. Always picks an action rule. 

How do I store a value at a certain time in an ensemble? And compare it?
If we want it to stay at a certain state for a longer time, scale the value of the target state. 


dot(action, turn) --> action=WAIT*0.1

using the input graph for debugging. 

nengolib is a colleciton of tools. 

Rolling window?
General thing that will remember information over a period of time.
